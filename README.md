# Rafi's dotfiles

This is largely based off of https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

To update your shell, `cd` into local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```
